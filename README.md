## 📊 Models Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Base model** provides a strong benchmark across the full dataset.
- **City-wise models** significantly improved performance by capturing local patterns.
- **XGBoost** achieved the best performance in most cities.

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
